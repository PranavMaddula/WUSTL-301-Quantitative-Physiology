This is a simulation of Hodgkin-Huxley equations using simulink blocks. 

See the original paper: 
Hodgkin,AL;Huxley,AF(1952).A quantitative description of ion currents and its applications to conduction and excitation in nerve membranes. J. Physiol.117:500-544.  

or 

have a look at a this useful review:

-      run HHparameters.m first to load required parameters 
- then run HH.mdl. Initially model is set to "Fixed Step Solver" with dt=0.001 but principally other dtS or "Variable Step Solver" should work.

thanks.
